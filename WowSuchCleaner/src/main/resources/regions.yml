# This file stores the mappings between regions, auction config profiles and cleaning profiles.
# The following is an example to disable cleaning & auctioning in the world named `thatWorld`. Uncomment to activate.
# Note: If you're creating an entire-world region by editing this file, just set `region` to the world's name. The plugin
# will do the conversion automatically.
